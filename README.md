# Causal-associations-diabetes-twitter



Identification of causal relations in diabetes related tweets using Deep learning.

A preprint of this work is published here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01225#

# The workflow is at follows:
 - Filtering only tweets containing an emotional element to focus on psychological factors (e.g. stress, anxiety, emotions.. related to diabetes)
 - Identify causal sentences: sentences which are likely to contain a cause-effect pair
 - Identify cause-effect pairs in causal sentences
 - Semi-supervised clustering of the identified cause-effect pairs
 - Visualisation of the identified cause-effect clusters in an interactive network -> [HERE](https://observablehq.com/@adahne/cause-and-effect-associations-in-diabetes-related-tweets)
